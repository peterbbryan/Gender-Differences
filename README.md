# Gender-Differences
Checking for differences in overregularization rates between male and female children

# Motivation
In collaboration with Charles Yang and Kyle Gorman, I have developed a Python package to identify correct past-tense tokens and overregularized tokens in the CHILDES database. Using this information, we investigate the reported differences in overregularization rates between male and female children.

# Arguments

    -s, --scriptdir (default "scripts/")

    -t, --tagger (default NLTK)

    -x, --overwrite (false)

    -o, --outputdir (default "output_$TAGGERNAME")
