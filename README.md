# Gender-Differences
Checking for differences in overregularization rates between male and female children

# Motivation
In collaboration with Charles Yang and Kyle Gorman, I have developed a Python package to identify correct past-tense tokens and overregularized tokens in the CHILDES database. Using this information, we investigate the reported differences in overregularization rates between male and female children.
