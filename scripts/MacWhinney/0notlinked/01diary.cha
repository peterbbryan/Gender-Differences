@Comment:	Ross was conceived in March. Mary took no drugs , liquor and little coffee. One chest x-ray in 3rd month with no shield. First movement was hiccups in 4th month. Kicking from 5th month. Most kicking in 7th and 8th month was outwards.@*Kicking was into diaphragm in last three weeks. Ross was less likely to kick when Mary was moving. He kicked a lot before Mary's bedtime and after coffee.
@Comment:	We had a party Christmas Eve. Betty Richardson was convinced that Mary was in labor already. On Christmas morning Mary felt good. About 11:00 a.m. she got "menstrual" pains and my family called. Maura said it was labor. I was convinced. By 2:00 p.m. the pains came at every 40 minutes. By 3:30 every 10 minutes. At 5:00 p.m. we drove to the hospital. When Mary checked in at 5:30 p.m. she was having contractions every four minutes. She went from four cm. to 10 cm. by 8:30 p.m. The baby was born at 8:39 p.m. Christmas Day. He came out facing Mary's front. Weight was 7 lbs. 3 oz. Length was 19 in. Apgar was 9-9.

@Comment:	He crosses his eyes when he looks at us.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.10
@Comment:	He generally looks at things without focus , but he is getting better at focusing now and crosses his eyes less often. He usually looks at nearby objects , i.e. up to l.5 ft. However , he also looks at bright lights.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.15
@Comment:	He is fascinated by the stripes on both of our shirts. He sits and tracks the stripes back and forth. He follows a hand moving through space , but without continual ability.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.22
@Comment:	He followed Mary's hand perfectly as she moved it.
@Comment:	At dance practice , Daisy was in front of him and bent down to pick up something. He tracked her head exactly as it moved down.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.27
@Comment:	Lying on his right side in his room and looking at his receiving blanket to his right he tracked up and down the pink and yellow stripes and gave a pleasure cry.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.06
@Comment:	Today for the first time Ross has directly regarded the yellow cat three times while I was holding him in my arms. The cat was sitting on the table about 1-1/2 feet away from him. I have put him within viewing distance of the cats before this but he has always acted as if they weren't there. This time Sunshine had been sitting and rolling on the table for a half hour before Ross finally focused on her. He looked at her face.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.06
@Comment:	I was holding Ross. My hair was wet and slicked back. Ross was sucking on a pacifier and staring at my face. I pulled at large wisps of my hair to make them stick out around my face. He stopped sucking for a moment and began to stare at the wisps and frowned mightily and sucked quickly. I then slicked it back again , the frown went away and he sucked more peacefully and his gaze returned to my face. I repeated the hair routine three times more resulting in frowns and wisp searching with the wisp style and a more placid expression with the slicked style. Sucking maintained a more uneffected pattern and the focus during the slicked style had about as much emphasis of focus on the hair line as on the face where the wispy style maintained focus on the hair line.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.10
@Comment:	Ross has spent most of his time during these last two weeks in looking at forms. At 0;1.10 he emphasized lines and geometric patterns. In particular he liked the stripes on the fabric on the stool in the living room at about two feet and the regularities in the bathroom , kitchen , and bed+room wallpaper. The bathroom came in first and the bed+room last.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.12
@Comment:	At around 0;1.12 he became interested in the lamp and the curtain rod as lines. At 0;1.15 he now starts to look at his first irregular patterns - the two jade plants and the triple-pronged cactus. His interest in these patterns wanes between 0;1.20 and 0;1.30. It is hard to tell whether he is most interested in their form or in depth processing across the branches.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.10
@Comment:	In the kitchen I noted a series of very rapid fixations one after another in which he looked over the room. Ross looks at our eyes a very long time.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.19
@Comment:	Ross looked intently at a large bald man who spoke to him. When the man left , Ross followed him with his eyes while craning his neck until the man got about 12 yards away. Ross watched about 30 seconds , until someone distracted him. Ross turned to look at the person nearby and then returned to looking at the bald man in the distance.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.20
@Comment:	Ross looks at me and follows me around the room with his eyes while he is in the crib in spite of other visual distractions - crib gym , mobile , etc.
@Comment:	Age 0;3.01
@Comment:	Ross seems to have perfected his eye-tracking. He can look at anything he wants to and keep it in view. From this time , his eye-tracking is limited not by motor control but conceptual reasons.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.14
@Comment:	Ross was on stomach propped up on his hands looking straight ahead. When I appreared eight feet away from him at his side , he turned his head toward me and his gaze finally broke from the chair it was fixed upon and caught up with his head to look straight at me. I then tried calling him a few times and the same thing happened; the turning of the head preceded the gaze.
@Comment:	Age 0;7.08
@Comment:	Ross put finger in mouth and looked at it cross-eyed. He doesn't do that with the spoon when I put it into his mouth. He is trying to watch his hand and he feels his mouth. Every once in a whle he has to uncross his eyes to relax them then he looks back at his hand. He seems to be focussing perfectly well. Now he seems to be comparing hands watching them as they hold each other or sticking the other in his mouth. It is breakfast time and there is food all over both of them which makes his hands more interesting to look at and feel. Ross always sits up and takes notice sometimes voicing when I pour out orange colored baby food into his bowl - no other color does this. I have also remembered that he has , for the last few weeks , shown great interest in all black objects - cat , microphone cords , cups , spoons , etc.
@Comment:	Age 0;7.11
@Comment:	This morning Ross was sitting up in his baby tenda watching the cats. He craned his body and stretched to see them as they went around a corner out of sight. He watches the last place , but makes a quick glance elsewhere to see if they reappear. He searches quite systematically and pays regard to their sounds or bells.
@Comment:	Age 1;0.20
@Comment:	He was in the bath and I was talking to him and I suddenly started to meow. He turned his head immediately 45 degrees and stared at me.

@Bg:	crying
@Comment:	Age 0;0.04
@Comment:	Crying at birth was mild , pleasant. Crying is accompanied by flailing of arms and legs if they are not restricted. Ross gets red-faced when crying. Crying with hunger is very strong. With a messy diaper and gas , it is strong. With loss of support , it is transient. He can be quiet a bit by contaact. Contact is defined mostly by pressure on front. Confinement of arms may be involved. On 0;0.4 Mary's milk began to flow and he started a one-hour crying fit. Perhaps this is a result of changing metabolism.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.07
@Comment:	Crying is significantly stronger. On the night when Mary's milk began to flow crying was intense. On the next day crying shows clearer strong onset for each cry. Two types of displeasure cries are evident. One has a heavy onset with fall. The other has an abrupt shriek at the end like Bulgarian singing. The second type is rarer.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.08
@Comment:	A new type of nasal cry emerges. Ross did 15 of these in a remarkable rhythm. They seem to code displeasure. But the rhythmicity made it seem like he was enjoying himself.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.09
@Comment:	While driving at 1:00 to Franklin for a PKU test he was quiet while car was in motion but cried every time it stopped.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.14
@Comment:	Ross has learned to cry - and shake his body - to get the mobile to move. When he cried , he also shook his body to get mobile to move. The crucial part here was shaking. However , I then responded to his crying by shaking the crib and the kicking dropped out. He ended up crying to shake the mobile.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.19
@Comment:	When set down bare in his cold tubby this morning Ross let out a scream so shrill and loud that Micah jumped out of the litterbox and ran out of the room.
@Comment:	Age 0;4.19
@Comment:	Ross' disposition has become remarkably cheerful. He smiles so much and spends so much time cooing and chattering that he cries very little. Crying no longer is accompanied by flailing of the arms and legs. It appears to be more independently controlled. He still cries when he has gas , but a bit less when his diaper is messy. Gas comes from strange foods: cow's milk , too much fruit , etc. Pain comes from occasionally hitting his head. Ross also cries when he wakes up from an uncomfortable sleep or gets too hot. It is now easier to soothe him through feeding , comforting , bathing , and a bit through games.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.25
@Comment:	Ross was being held by mother while she readied herself for his first morning feeding. As the breast was uncovered and held ready for Ross he focused on it , smiled and let out a gurgle.

@Comment:	Age 0;0.01
@Comment:	Frowning and brow wrinkling during crying and displeasure occur from birth. They seem to be integral parts of crying.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.10
@Comment:	While sleeping Ross exercised randomly about every facial expression of which he seems capable: frowns , eyebrow raising , smiling , mouth grimace , closed eye rolling and wound it all up with mouth puckering which turned into sucking movements. This continues - but perhaps not as frequently - in the next two weeks.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.18
@Comment:	Mary sees eye-smiling with mouth-smiling. On 0;0.23 I see mouth-smiling alone.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.02
@Comment:	When I produce a low roar , Ross wrinkles up his face as if he were about to cry but never actually cries.When I did this while he was looking at Gladstone (the bear) the reaction was particularly intense.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.01
@Comment:	He smiles for long periods of time while looking at me - up to two minutes on and off - but mostly on.
@Comment:	Age 0;6.15
@Comment:	For the last two months Ross has been smiling a great deal more. He smiles when he recognizes a face , when someone tickles him or kisses him or brushes him with their hair , when someone smiles at him , and when he succeeds on doing something like flipping over.
@Comment:	Age 1;0.20
@Comment:	Since eleven months he has shown a great deal more sophistication in being attentive to us , often attempting to imitate our facial expressions.

@Bg:	grasping
@Comment:	Age 0;0.10
@Comment:	Ross is finally able to hold the pacifier against his mouth for him to suck on it for a long period - up to a half hour or more. Part of this skill probably has to do with his more coordinated sucking but though he has always been a strong sucker , only a few days ago I was unable to leave the pacifier for Ross to use by himself.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.21
@Comment:	Greater frequency , duration , and coordination of this behavior over the last two weeks. Lying on his right side , after having pulled the pacifier out of his mouth accidently , he reached with his left hand and shoved the pacifier back against his mouth. He then grasped it with his lips. So the success of the grasping-reaching ability is really partly the success of sucking.
@Comment:	Age 0;0.23
@Comment:	Instead of using his hands to grasp the pacifier as at 0;0.21 , he turned his head to the pacifier and almost succeeded in grasping it with his lips. He was lying down with his arms crossed on his chest at the time.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.05
@Comment:	Ross had a hold of his pacifier with his fingers locked on it but with thumb uninvolved.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.14
@Comment:	Ross holds his pacifier against his mouth with the nipple part between index and second finger like some people smoke a cigarette. He also curls his first finger around the entire pacifier and at other times holds it against his mouth with the back of his hand.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.05
@Comment:	Lately within the last week Ross has been using his hands differently. Today he fingered and grasped the flower print on my bathrobe which he was looking at. Also he has been fingering his own hands and playing with them. For the last two weeks he has been grasping his head behind his ears when crying in extreme distress. (In retrospect we realized on 0;3.20 that the grasping of the head was because of a heater problem causing asphyxiation by carbon monoxide. He , in any case , still occasionally still puts his hand at his head in the same manner while sleeping or sucking from the bottle. For the last week at least Ross has been sucking on his hands with more facility. He favors his index finger and can get all his finagers in his mouth at once. He also can hold onto his gums which he did today.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.12
@Comment:	Because I felt that Ross was on the verge of some real grasping activity I have taken down his mobile which he usually watches to the exclusion of all else in hopes that his attention would focus on the cradle gym. It worked and he began to play with it and was often seen with a ring in his hand.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.13
@Comment:	While feeding , Ross fingers and holds while studying intently the flowers on my bathrobe. He also is holding and fingering his own hands.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.14
@Comment:	For the first time I have offered Ross a very small handled rattle which he grasped and held for a long time. I have offered the larger key-ring rattle before without the same quality of success in that he never seemed to handle it as if he enjoyed it. The small red rattle is different - more rigid , like an extension of his hand.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.20
@Comment:	Ross is doing all of the above with increased frequency and ability.
@Comment:	Age 0;3.15
@Comment:	Holding. Ross has just begun to hold the red rattle and shakes it. When he previously held the rattle , no shaking was done.
@Comment:	Age 0;3.22
@Comment:	For two weeks Ross has been craming the pacifier back into his mouth when it falls half way out. Sometimes it goes back in sideways but he is getting better coordinated about the attempts. Now there is no flailing or panic involved. Now , Ross reaches out with both hands and smiles. When given the bottle and with some help , he can support the bottle using his lips mainly to control the bottle.
@Comment:	Age 0;4.02
@Comment:	After Ross had been handed the bottle while on his back , gripped it with both hands and held it in his mouth tilted correctly - his attention was drawn to the side and he turned his head to see but then returned to the original position and back to the bottle reinserting the bottle into his mouth. His arms were not resting on his body but self-supporting and holding on capably to the bottle. This position was maintained for a bit and then the process repeated.
@Comment:	Age 0;4.10
@Comment:	While sucking on bottle and looking off to the left Ross grabbed Brian's face with his right hand. This was interesting because he was enjoying using grasping without vision. Ross held the bottle all by himself for five minutes. He has about three techniques for holding the bottle: a. one hand at the end of the bottle and one on the side of the nipple; b. one or two hands at the end; c. the vise grip (a hand on either side). In later weeks the vise grip at the end becomes his only method , i.e. strength of other allomorphs declines.
@Comment:	Age 0;4.15
@Comment:	Today , when I took Ross to the dentist with me , I put the pacifier on his lap at home and when we arrived at the dentist's office I found him sucking on the pacifier. On the return trip I again put the pacifier on his lap and after just a few minutes he was craming it in his mouth.
@Comment:	Age 0;4.19
@Comment:	Ross holds his bottle better each day. He now even tips it up for a short period of time. However , it still is most often hugged or held close to the body. (By 0;5.8 Ross was using the bottle very well. He tips it up when it gets too empty @u(if) he is awake enough to notice. He enjoys very much his cup - he will grasp it by the handles and tip it to his mouth. He still is unable to drink it properly because the liquid flows down his stomach.) Ross still loves to study his hands except now they have become a little less delicate in their movements - changing from single finger movement to unison finger movements as he opens and closes his fist he twists his hand at the wrist exposing the entire hand to his view. Ross has quite an interest in his training cup. He especially likes its slender handles which he can grip easily. He seems to treat it much like a bottle - shoving the mouth piece against his cheek and eventually getting it into his mouth.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.01
@Comment:	Ross took the rubber teething pretzel with his right hand , chewed on it , gripped it with his left hand and also chewed on it , looked at it , and then let go with his right hand , thus transferring the object from one hand to the other. He does this in reverse also and though he generally inspects the object before transferring it , he does not always chew on it. Brian held Ross' right hand and held out the object to Ross on his right side forcing Ross to reach across his body and grasp it with his left hand.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.03
@Comment:	Wrist Rotation: he lays on his back and twists at the wrists and ankles and makes vowel sounds and smiles. He has been doing this for the last week. He also likes to do this with a rattle in his hand.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.08
@Comment:	Ross seems to be about ready to retrieve the bottle after it has dropped. I have seen him drop the bottle onto the bed while lying on his back and drinking. He half rolled over and reached with the opposing arm (dropped by his left side , he rolled leftward and reached with right hand). He didn't get the bottle because I distracted him. He makes a game these days of taking the bottle out of his mouth and putting it back in. He uses two hands for this.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.13
@Comment:	While laying on his back Ross dropped his bottle to his left , reached with his left hand and grasped the body of the bottle and stuck it back into his mouth.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.25
@Comment:	Ross reaches over his head to retrieve a T shirt or other things. This while sitting in car seat.
@Comment:	Age 0;6.10
@Comment:	This morning I saw Ross on his stomach pick up his bottle which was laying on the floor of the playpen , roll over and put the nipple end of the bottle in his mouth.
@Comment:	Age 0;8.01
@Comment:	He can grasp with opposite finger and thumb. He seems to prefer the second finger in the ninth month.
@Comment:	Age 0;10.01
@Comment:	Ross was sucking on empty bottle. I was diapering him. He gave a small complaint (presumably about the bottle) so I presented him with the full one which he took with his left hand while handing the empty bottle to me with his right hand - (my other hand was before him ready to take it). Up to now I have had to pry the empty one away though over the last two weeks he has fought less and less over the exchange. (By 1;0.5 , he has gotten entirely cooperative about this).
@Comment:	Age 0;10.01
@Comment:	Ross holds his roly poly chimes ball like a ball with opposing hands instead of simple putting it or pushing it with one hand as he did at seven months. He now holds @u(and) pats. Fine motor: on approximately 0;10.20 I noticed that Ross adroitly poked his index finger into the little holes of the shower door along the bath+tub edge.

@Comment:	Age 1;0.20
@Comment:	He has been doing some two hand grasping of two objects for two months. This month he has become very tenacious at holding on to both objects. He is excellent at lifting his legs , waving his arms , etc. while we dress him. I would say that he has this down to a fine art. He can put sticks in rings , pound hammers on things , pull wagons , pull off clothes , finger buttons , press on his press-the man wagon , climb down the stairs. To some degree he can feed himself , but we don't let him.

@Comment:	Age 0;0.04
@Comment:	During pregnancy Ross slept most of the night and much of the day. Now he sleeps in cycles of about four hours: He sleeps two hour , gets hungry , wakes up for a half hour , gets hungrier , cries , defecates , eats , and then goes back to sleep.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.10
@Comment:	Ross sleeps pretty much through the night. He takes about four major naps during the day. Sleeping at night is facilitated by a full tummy. He can nap almost anywhere under the most noisy and hassling conditions.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.15
@Comment:	For the last couple of days I have found Ross sleeping on his side. This has occurred after a consistent unyielding preferance to sleeping on his back since soon after birth he was able to move from the side position which I tried to maintain from hospital till about three months. Then I gave up all together. He has never slept on his stomach. By the way - his daddy sleeps on his side.

@Comment:	Age 0;0.09
@Comment:	He turns immediately to breast (even on Brian) , and starts sucking movements. When fussy he quiets at a shift in position as if he is expecting to get a nipple.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.01
@Comment:	I have begun to feed Ross rice cereal this week. The first feeding ended in a bottle feeding. The second was more successful and by the third he seemed to have the hang of preparing his mouth to receive the spoon. Also he does more of an adult-like swallowing instead of sucking motions with the tongue.
@Comment:	Age 0;3.20
@Comment:	Ross now grabs food with his lips and swallows without the tongue shoving that was involved with earlier eating.
@Comment:	Age 0;3.21
@Comment:	Breast feeding is almost completely phased out now. It amounts to one short feeding per day at the most.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.10
@Comment:	He can make click sounds by using sucking movements.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.25
@Comment:	Last week Ross would spit out everything that we put in his mouth no matter how hungry he was. Yesterday and today I found I can feed him well in the morning when he is very hungry but I have_to keep the food well mixed with cereal. As soon as I give him peas or squash straight he began to spit again. This is either because he doesn't like them or because it is so easy with a pureed vegetable.
@Comment:	Age 0;6.15
@Comment:	His spitting of food has pretty much stopped. It is hard to tell why. Perhaps , he found he wasn't getting enough to eat; or perhaps he got bored of it; or perhaps he saw that it displeased us. Today he was able to blow his spit into little bubbles.

@Comment:	Age 0;1.20
@Comment:	He braces before being put down in his tubby and suddenly relaxes when he finds it warms. This is convincing at 0;2.0. Before this he seemed to worry from loss of support. He also braces as water is being poured from 0;1.10 , but this is not as sharp as his bracing while being put down. He @u(may) anticipate being taken for a drive or walk from 0;1.20. He shows unhappiness about being put in the crib. He shows no clear anticipation of nursing.
@Comment:	Age 0;3.21
@Comment:	When the bottle is presented to Ross he reaches out with both hands and smiles.
@Comment:	Age 0;3.27
@Comment:	When I pick up Ross by the hands and putt him up in the air he has to tighten his shoulders to help. Then immediately following when I give him my hands he reacts and skrunches his shoulders in anticipation of the game. Notice that this is not as advanced as entry 0;3.21 concerning the bottle. I was cutting Ross' fingernails today while he was sucking on the bottle. As I worked on each finger he spread his fingers and helped to isolate the one I was working on. When I finished the first hand and reached for the other he gave me the second hand. This is all quite different from previous fingernail episodes where he cried and tried to ball up his fist and take it away. By 0;6.10 he was still doing this althought somewhat more passively.
@Comment:	Age 0;4.19

@Comment:	Now his processing of our faces seems to work toward memorization. In particular , he seems to be trying to memorize Mary's face.
@Comment:	Age 0;2.01
@Comment:	During 0;1.23 - 0;2.0 Ross showed a tendency to look at Mary. At 0;1.29 he seemed to not want to leave Mary's lap to come to Brian's. However , at 0;2.0 he spent a lot of time looking at me and decided I wasn't so bad after all. It was as if he was trying to memorize my face. He does this particularly while sucking. From 0;1.20 to 0;2.0 the tracking is systematic enough to suggest memorization.

@Comment:	While lying in his tubby side awake , Ross repeated mother's lip movements forming an /o/ shape four times with rests and signs of concentration between but it disintegrated into tongue movements which I had not done. Distinct /heh/ sounds made while Brian was holding him.
@Comment:	Age 0;1.06
@Comment:	Ross , while being held , was making /o/ shape with his mouth while staring up at my face so I stuck out my tongue and he did too. I then made my mouth into an /o/ shape and then a moment after he shaped the /o/. I stuck out my tongue until he stuck out his. These two movements were repeated 4-5 times more until , while I was sticking out my tongue and his was still making an /o/ his gaze wandered to my shoulder and he made an /heh/ sound. So I formed my mouth into an /o/ regained his attention and made an /ooo/ sound. After a moment of concentration , he repeated his /heh/ sound. I repeated the shape and sound and he opened his mouth wide into an /o/ shape as if to yawn , crossed his eyes with concentration , and repeated the /heh/ sound. We tried again and succeeded three times and then two times in addition with Brian looking on.

He drew in his breath again voicing while smiling.
@Comment:	Age 0;3.20
@Comment:	Ross is calling out - the differences between these crys and noises is that they are much better projected and seem to have the intention of being heard. During these calls he doesn't seem to be unhappy or in need. Little laryngealization. If unattended , he starts fussing.
@Comment:	Age 0;4.19
@Comment:	Ross uses two sounds most frequently now , /ehh/ and a uvular trill , as a means of communication. He uses both to get us to look at him and to get us to give him back his bottle. His sounds have become much narrower in s scope and consist mostly of the /ehh/ the uvular trill and a throaty growl like he is clearning his throat or bearing down for a bowel movement. Ross has been vocalizing less lately. Even less than he was a couple of weeks ago. He does still do a lot of gurgling though but most of his sounds seem to be of an expressive intent rather than experimental. He has been producing some different things but they are so infrequent that they are hard to capture on tape. He has said /gu/.

@Comment:	I seem unable to catch interesting sounds on the tape recorder because they are normally made while I'm bathing him in the morning and usually so infrequent that by the time I get to the recorder Ross becomes distracted and won't continue. /Deh , Deh/ is his recent and /meh , meh/ along with some very expressive intonation. Other sounds include /ded/ / he/ /a:ge/ and /gu/. Mostly CV , CVC , and VCV. No longer strings. Few labials.

@Comment:	He makes a [T] sound repeatedly without any accompaning vowel. He does a little growl when he doesn't want food. This is with his mouth closed. He makes a loud scream , then follows it with a little soft scream. All sounds seem to have place harmony , i.e. front vowels with front consonants back vowels with back vowels.

@Comment:	While having breakfast yesterday , I decided that I should talk to Ross , so I looked him straight in the eyes and told him all sorts of things. I used full sentences , paragraphs , etc. and dialogue. He gazed back and quit eating - all he wanted to do was watch and listen. Today while having breakfast he began to make "p" sounds so I did a few then I switched to pa pa pa. After starring at me with his head cocked forward , not unlike a dog , he began to do pa pa sounds - actually more like a cross between pa and ba which is a bva sound. Anyway I realized that Ross is really listening now if you direct the sounds to him.

@Comment:	A week ago , last Saturday or Sunday , October 7 or 8 , Micah was being very attentive. So I said "kitty" as I petted him and Ross , who wanted to get at the cat , reached from his high chair , looked at me questionally and said "keee." Ever since that I have been petting the cat and saying "kitty." Today when we came home from the babysitter Sunshine was rolling about on the ground. I set Ross down and he reached out and said "keee." Ross now uses the word "keee" infrequently but correctly.

@Comment:	Until now Ross has responded to sounds mostly on terms of startle. He does not turn in the direction of a sound for example his musical mobile - the motion part which he is addicted to doesn't seem to be associated with the sound of the music. He does not look at the mobile because he hears the music - he only looks at it when he notices it moving. (I have tried putting up just the music part and he does not search for it.) Indeed , Ross has been showing little interest in sounds at all. I have sung to him with very little indication that it is important to him. Today , however , I played a music box (Brahms Lullaby) while he was crying and he stopped crying and stayed still for some time. He did not look in the direction of the box - he only seemed to be awake and interested in the sound. Yesterday I sang songs to Ross. I sing very high and use repetitive songs - "Swing Low" "Goodnight Ladies , " etc. He seemed to attend to the sound and studied my face intently until he fell asleep.

@Comment:	Ross stands supporting his full weight while being balanced with an adult hand or two. Penny had him standing in the infant bed while he held on to her. He also has stood up from a haunch position on the couch by sliding his back up the back of the couch. He crawls by arching his back and balancing on his head and then thrusting his feet together.

@Comment:	Sitting: Today Ross sat in my lap while being supported on one side which was in contact with my body. He also sits while being held with one arm.
@Comment:	Age 0;4.19
@Comment:	Ross turns from back to front and from front to back. He has just begun to really play with his feet as well as his hands. He can hold himself up from the waist up on his two hands while lying on his stomach. While lying on his back , he arches his back and holds himself in mid air supporting the weight on his head and on his feet. He lies on his side by crossing his legs or placing the top arm across to maintain the position.

@Comment:	Every once in a while we take Ross "swimming" with us in the bath tub. He loves to kick and slap the water with his hands. He pinches his mouth shut to keep the water out. While on his back he occasionally wants to look at the water that laps about his cheeks. He turns toward the water to look at it , this is while floating on his back supported at the shoulders , but as he turned his head he would feel the water come up on his cheeks and he would right his head quickly and pinch his lips together.

@Comment:	This morning I saw Ross make an arch while on his stomach by putting his feet on the floor and leaving his arms and face on the floor also. I'm sure he is ready to take off.
@Comment:	Age 0;5.15
@Comment:	Ross can roll over from any position with great facility. He sleepson his back and , within the last 2 days , on his side. He sucks on his fingers a little but doesn't seem to have a habit of it , nor does he have the pacifier habit. Mary has used the pacifier quite sparingly. He holds his bottle and once he picked it up and put it into his mouth after having dropped it. He eats cereal , yogurt , egg yolk , peaches , apricots , applesauce , apple juice , squash , and carrots. He drinks formula. I feed him with a small spoon. He likes to grasp the training cup and handles it well but still slops most of the juice down his front. He picks up and enjoys his toys now: yellow giraffe , keys , rubber pretzel , rattle. He enjoys looking at and feeling Paddington. He chews fingers and anything and will shake it if it makes a noise. Last night he looked at me first by turning the head and then allowing his eyes to catch up with his head. He just now seems to look in the direction of a noise. Music will still him temporarily. Ross still does not sit up by himself , though he sits well with a little support. He loves to stand and can do so for a long time without bobbing up and down but he weaves and needs support by one arm to stay up. He scoots on his back with great speed. He squeals and can express disgust at tasting things like yogurt. He screams , scrunches up his face , and then growls.

@Comment:	Ross can sit very well when well supported but he still cannot sit without a seatback and evven with a seatback he will eventually fall to the side. Most of his learning to sit seems to be based on learning not to kick or shift weight and to hold his back straight. By 0;6.19 he could sit by himself in his tubby.
@Comment:	Age 0;6.19
@Comment:	At 0;6.19 he began to alternate legs in forward crawling but failed to crawl. He had a good arm extension but he had too little single leg traction. Today he "walked" with alternation and also succeeded in crawling about one foot , with foot alternation. The practice on alternation was quite purposeful.
@Comment:	Age 0;6.20
@Comment:	He "swims" with support by hand flapping and two-foot thrusting. When seated in water he bats the water with his hands.
@Comment:	Age 0;8.01
@Comment:	By July 16th Ross sat up. About three days later he got on all fours and crawled. About July 24th we went into his room and he was standing in his crib. By July 22nd he was practicing getting down from the couch feet first.
@Comment:	Age 0;6.22
@Comment:	Ross recovered a sitting position from lying down at least three times. This is the first time I have seen him do this. Five minutes later he is still doing it --oops I just heard a thud.
@Comment:	Age 0;6.27
@Comment:	Ross has diuscovered how much he really wants to get at Micah. Today he was petting him on the couch. Micah jumped down so Ross began to go after the cat. I helped him fall off the couch softly on his head. He got into the crawl position swiftly and CRAWLED straight for Micah. Micah moved and eventually returned to the couch. I HELPED Ross to stand up to couch from a sitting position. The only things he does so far totally by himself are: Roll in every direction; Get into a sitting position; Crawl; Pick up his bottle from the floor and put it into his mouth eventually the nipple end (he hasn't realized yet that the bottle must be tipped or that he must lay on his back to use the bottle). By the last week of June he began to roll over on his side and therefore would also drink from the bottle while still on his side.
@Comment:	Age 0;8.10
@Comment:	Ross saw me walk by with his bottle. I set it on the third stair going up. He began to whimper , crawled to the stair , stood up and then hunched over while hanging on then climbed onto the first stair which enabled him to reach the bottle.
@Comment:	Age 0;8.10
@Comment:	I set Ross into his playpen on his feet. He stood a few moments with no support and , quite unwaveringly , he then sat down. This is the first he has ever really stood alone although he has been hanging onto things with only one hand and trying to let go but he usually has had to grab on again to prevent falling.
@Comment:	Age 0;10.08
@Comment:	Ross watched the Appalachian clogging and moved very consistenly to the music in a similarly bouncing pattern. The interesting thing was that it was in short concerted spurts - three to four bounces and a pause all the while concentrating on the dancers. (The adult pattern is three shuffles and one ball and chain.)

@Comment:	As I was holding Ross and concentrating on a puzzle in front of me , Ross repeatedly kicked my arm until I turned my head to look down at his face and said "hello." He broke into a big smile and cooed loudly. Lately he has been showing intentional behavior such as the above , for example , kicking the pitcher as I pour water on him. Ross also cries extra loud when he drops the bottle that he has been trying to hold by himself. He doesn't seem so disturbed if he hasn't been exerting any effort.

@Comment:	While bathing Ross noticed that my leg , which he put his hand on to lean in order to stabilize himself , was slightly stubby. After patting it and stroking it a couple of times he looked at the part next to my knee which was smooth , reached over and felt it and then he spent some time feeling one and then the other.

@Comment:	Age 1;0.20
@Comment:	He is still interested in looking at himself in the mirror but somewhat less so. From about the sixth to the tenth month Ross was very interested in other people's body features - hair , breasts , noses , etc. However , in the tenth to the thirteenth month this interest clearly subsided and he ended up in the thirteenth month occasionally only looking at my nose.

@Comment:	I was practicing Ross with his cup. He held the handle and I guided the cup to his mouth , allowing enough juice to run into his mouth. I then tipped the cup upright to give him a moment to tongue it and swallow if he could , (most of it ran down his stomach). Then I would repeat the action. I did this about ten times then let him grip the handle and do it himself. I observed that he used the same pattern that I had and the same intervals.

@Comment:	I played with Ross' hammer and peg bench again showing him how to hold the hammer and how to hit with it. Also , I put it in his hand and helped him hit. From time to time he would hand the hammer back to me for another demonstration. Once he grabbed my wrist and put the hammer in my hand. (That is the way I did to him.) Over a month ago , I showed him how to hammer and he imitated but didn't hand it back but he would pause so I could help him. From then on he knew what to do with the hammer and the bench.

@Comment:	Play. Ross is silent when the cat steps on him or growls at each other. He likes to touch them with his hands silently. He also likes to feel my hair much in the same manner that he feels the cats' fur. Ross grabs Brian's mustache , folds of flesh on ones stomach , locks of my hair and necklaces and all forms of jewelery.

@Comment:	I opened my hands and Ross puts his hand in the palms of my hands so I closed one hand on top covering his hand with mine. He smiled and drew away his hand , so I opened my hands again and waited until he placed his hand on mine again. We repeated this game for several times until both Ross and I were tired of it.
