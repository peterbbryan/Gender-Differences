@Situation:	Teaching
@Comment:	The child could not be motivated to do the teaching tasks.
	All 3 tasks were attempted. On the first two (manipulating 2 small
	figures) he repeatedly asked "Why?" , in other words , why am I
	doing this. He would not practice the tasks with the exception of
	stringing beads , the last task. Jarrett had problems stringing the
	beads and could not , or would not , teach his mother despite
	coaxing from both the examiner and his mother.
